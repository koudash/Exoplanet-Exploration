# Exoplanet-Exploration

<p>In this project, four machine learning models (<strong>Random Forest</strong>, <strong>Support Vector Machine</strong>, <strong>K-Nearest Neighbors</strong>, and <strong>Neural Network</strong>) were built to facilitate classifying candidate exoplanets from the raw dataset generated by the <strong>NASA Kepler space telescope</strong>.</p>

<p>Specifically, after removing features like "kepid", "kepler_name", etc from the dataset, corrlation in between each remaining two features were calculated and compared with a set of correlation threshold. Those higher than threshold were considered functionally redundant and only one copy of such feature is retained for determination of correlation threshold to be used in this study by random forest model. Based on the following chart, <strong>correlation threshold at 0.45 with as few as 15 features</strong> was used thereafter.</p>

<p>I next checked the skrewness and kurtosis of data in the final 15 features and got the fact that not all of the features, or a large majority of them to be specific, were not normally distributed. This limited our ML models of choice to be RF, SVM KNN. Neural Network model was also applied in this project.</p>

<p>Categorical labels from target ("koi_disposition") were transformed to numerical and one-hot encoded, whereas numerical features were scaled using <code>MinMaxScaler</code>. Four models were generated in parallel and models were all fine tuned with <code>GridSearchCV</code>.</p>

<p>After ML model generation, their performances were evaluated and compared. It can be told from the following plot that dispite all models were very good at isolating cohorts that are proven to be false positive, <strong>RF</strong> is superior over the rest in terms of achieveing the highest precision and re-call; it also exihibited the highest training and testing scores, all of which makes it the most promising ML model built in this project.</p>
